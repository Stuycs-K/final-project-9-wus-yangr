"Ah, good to see you awake. That was quite the crash."
1 - Nod.
2 - "Crash?"
"You crashed off the southern coast." The man waves vaguely.
3 - "I've had worse."
"Yes, well." The man adjusts his glasses.
> REPUTATION_RECKLESS++
4 - "Were you the one that patched me up?"
"I was." The man adjusts his glasses.
"You can't stay for long. There's a hurricane coming in the next day or two, although the latest reports suggest it'll be sooner rather than later."
1 - "Alright, I'll be on my way, then."
"Not so fast."
> REPUTATION_RECKLESS++
2 - "How bad is the hurricane?"
"Bad enough that you'll crash again if you try flying in that mess."
"I'm no wrench monkey, but your ship took some damage. You'll want to take a look at that, make whatever repairs you need so you can leave."
1 - "Okay, thanks for the info." [Leave.]
"I hope I won't see you in my clinic again, but if you need any medical assistance, you know where to find me."
2 - "Where's my ship?"
"Tethered to the Dive Point. Take a right as soon as you leave the clinic, you'll be there." He points at the direction where, presumably, your ship is.
3 - "Where can I get repairs?"
"Talk to the Mechanic. Leave the industrial district, her shop's the first thing you see in Central."
4 - "How badly was I hurt?"
"You were lucky to get away with just a broken arm. I put you under, shot you up with some nanites. You might experience some soreness in the coming days."
4-1 - "Nanites?"
    - DOC_NAME
4-2 - Nod in thanks.
5 - "Where am I?"
The man cracks a smile. "Hailan, little colony in the middle of nowhere."
5-1 - "Interesting."
    - "Oh, no, it's not an interesting place."
5-2 - "Tell me more."
6 - "Who are you?"
"You can call me Doc."
