## Overview
A narrative-centric open-world point-and-click RPG. You crash land near Hailan, an in-water city. Thereâ€™s a hurricane on the horizon, and you have a day to repair your ship and leave before the waves sweep your ship away. Learn more about this dilapidated city and its inhabitants as you search for the components to repair your ship. Talk to NPCs for leads.

## Instructions
Explore the map, talk to npcs, and collect the 3 items needed to repair the ship.

NPCs = colored circles
Interactable Items = colored rectangles
Ship = teal colored rectangle at the bottom of the map

When engaged in dialogue, only click the numbers corresponding to the options available or else the program will break and it will need to be rerun to reset it.

After collecting all 3 items, you can return to the ship and repair it.
